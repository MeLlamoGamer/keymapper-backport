To use KeyMapper in modern versions of Windows, you will have to manually switch to 'Boot' mappings from the Mappings menu, reboot to change the mappings, and you will need to have Administrative access to your computer.

This is because both Windows XP and Vista supported per-user key mappings written to . Until the next release of Key Mapper, .

If you are using Windows XP or Vista, Key Mapper allows remapping and disabling keys for each user on the computer, so it's possible to have one set of mappings that is enabled at boot time, and a different set for each user who logs on to the computer, and key mappings can be set without Administrative rights.

Key Mapper uses a virtual keyboard to create and show mappings. It will change the keyboard to reflect whatever keyboard the user currently has active. You can browse the keyboards installed on your PC if you like.

As a convenience for people who have disabled the Caps Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock keys, Key Mapper has a facility to toggle the value of these keys, in case - for example - an application sets Caps Lock on but the key is disabled.

Key Mapper is a Windows Form application written in C#, targeting the .NET Framework 2.0\. Most people download the MSI installer or the Setup package (which use the Native Image Generator ([NGEN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf(VS.80).aspx)) to optimise the application at install) but there's a plain .exe version as well.
